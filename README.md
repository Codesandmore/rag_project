## 📌 Project Overview

The project is designed to **familiarize students with RAG-based architectures** by dividing them into specialized teams. Most of the participants are beginners, so the focus is on learning and collaboration.

### 🔹 Teams & Responsibilities

- **📄 PDF Creation Team:** Prepares and organizes documents for processing.
- **📖 Parsing & Vectorization Team:** Handles text extraction and converts it into vector embeddings.
- **🤖 Model Development & Training Team:** Works on fine-tuning models for RAG.
- **🔗 Backend Integration Team:** Ensures seamless model integration into APIs.
- **🖥️ Frontend Integration Team:** Develops the UI for user interaction.

## 🏗️ Workspace Structure

The workspace is organized as follows:

📂 **data/** - Contains dataset files and processed information.  
📂 **docs/** - Documentation and references for the project.  
📂 **src/** - Source code for different components.  
📂 **tests/** - Unit tests and validation scripts.  

*(Refer to the provided workspace structure image for more details.)*
